# Python Rutgers Bootcamp Challenge - API Challenge 

This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

## Description

In this assignment, I used the concepts I learned to begin working with APIs, using two API, OpenWeatherMap API and Geoapify, to analyze, manipulate, and 

## pybank

In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. You'll use the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

For this part, you'll use the WeatherPy.ipynb Jupyter notebook provided in the starter code ZIP file. The starter code will guide you through the process of using your Python coding skills to develop a solution to address the required functionalities.

To get started, the code required to generate random geographic coordinates and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude combination is provided.

Requirement 1: Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
To fulfill the first requirement, you'll use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the starter code. Next, you'll create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Latitude vs. Temperature

Latitude vs. Humidity

Latitude vs. Cloudiness

Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship
To fulfill the second requirement, compute the linear regression for each relationship. Separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude). You may find it helpful to define a function in order to create the linear regression plots.

Next, create a series of scatter plots. Be sure to include the linear regression line, the model's formula, and the r values as you can see in the following image

## pypoll

PyBank Instructions

In this Challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote

Your analysis should align with the following results:

### Dependencies

* Must have GitBash used as an application for Microsoft Windows environments which provides an emulation layer for a Git command line experience noting commands for analysis

* Must have Visual Studio Code 

### Installing

* Download the VBA raw data and copy and paste it while in VBA Developer mode in Excel. 
* No modifications needed to be made to files/folders

### Python Code - pybank & pypoll

* pybank Python code in folder named "pybank_solution"
* pypoll Python code in folder named "pypoll_solution"


## Help

No issues as it runs well on Microsoft Excel. Do recommend erasing the updated data to check the code every time.
